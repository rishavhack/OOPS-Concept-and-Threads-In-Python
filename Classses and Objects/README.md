# Classes and Object

>The entire OOPS methodology has been derived from a single root concept called **Object**. Every object has some behavior. The behavior of an object is represented by attributes and actions. For Example, Let's take a person whose name is 'Rishav'. Rishav is an object because he exists physically. He has attributes like name,age,sex,etc.These attributes can be represented by variables in programming. 
Similarly, Rishav can perfrom some action like talking,walking,eating and sleeping etc. These action are performed by methods. We should understand that a function written inside a class is called a method.So an object contain variable and methods.
>It is possible that some object may have similar behavior. Such object belong to same category called a **Class**.For example, not only Rishav,but all other person have various common attributes and actions.So they are all objects of same class,'Person'. Now observe that the 'Person' will not exist physically but only Rishav,Ravi,Sita etc. exist physically. This means, a class is a group name and does not exist physically, but objects exist physically
