# OOPS Concept In Python
### There are two types of programming
**1.Procedure oriented programming**
>The languages like C,Pascal,Fortran etc, are called Procedure oriented language since in these languages, a programmer uses procedures or functions to perform a task. While developing software, the main task is divided into several sub tasks and each sub task is represented as a procedure or function.The main task is thus composed if several procedures and functions. This approach is called Procedure oriented approach.

**2.Object oriented programming**
>On the other hand languages like C++,Python,Java anf Python use classes and object in their programs and are called Object oriented languages. A class is a module which it self contains data and method(function) to achieve the task. The main task is divied into several sub tasks, and these are represented as classes. Each class can perform several inter-releated tasks for which several methods are written iin a class. This approach is called Object oriented approach.
